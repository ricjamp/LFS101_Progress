# Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
- Explore the filesystem and its hierarchy.
- Explain the filesystem layout and the purpose of important directories.
- List common filesystem types used in Linux.
- Understand disk partitions and mounting and checking filesystems.
- Use NFS.
- Compare files and identify different file types.
- Back up and compress data.

## Filesystems
- =="Everything is a file"== is an often repeated adage quoted by users of Linux (and all UNIX-like OSs)
- whether you are dealing with normal data files and documents, or with devices such as sound cards and printers, this means interaction with them proceeds through the same Input/Output (I/O) operations you commonly use with files
- this simplifies things: 
	- you open a "file" and perform normal operations like reading and writing it (which is one reason why text editors are so important)
- on many systems (including Linux), the filesystem is ==structured like a tree==.
- the tree is usually portrayed as inverted and starts at what is most often called the ==root directory==, which marks the beginning of the hierarchical filesystem and is also sometimes referred to as the trunk and simply denoted by '/'
- the root directory is not the same as the root user
- the hierarchical filesystem also contains other elements in the path (directory names), which are separated by forward slashes (/)
	- as in, "/usr/bin/emacs", where the last element is the actual file name
- ==Filesystem Varieties==:
	- Linux native
		- ext3
		- ext4
		- squashfs
		- btrfs
	- also supports other OS filesystems:
		- Windows (ntfs, vfat, exfat)
		- SGI (xfs)
		- IBM (jfs)
		- MacOS (hfs, hfs+)
	- the most advanced filesystem types in common use are the "journaling" varieties:
		- ext4, xfs, btrfs, and jfs
		- these have many state-of-the-art features and high performance, and are not easy to corrupt accidentally
	- Linux also makes use of network (or distributed) filesystems, where all or part of the filesystem is on external machines:
		- NFS, Ceph, Lustre, and OpenAFS
- ==Linux Partitions==:
	- in most situations, each filesystem on a Linux system occupies a disk partition
	- partitions help to organize the contents of disks according to the kind and use of the data contained
	- eg. important programs required to run the system are often kept on a separate partition (known as root or '/') than the one that contains files owned by regular users of that system (/home)
		- in addition, temporary files created and destroyed during the normal operation of Linux may be located on dedicated partitions
		- one advantage of this kind of isolation by type and variability is that when all available space on a particular partition is exhausted, the system may still operate normally
		- furthermore, if data is either corrupted through error or hardware failure, or breached through a security problem, it might be possible to confine problems to an area smaller than the entire system
- ==Mount Points==:
	- before you can start using a filesystem, you need to mount it on the filesystem tree at a mount point
	- this is simply a directory (which may or may not be empty) where the filesystem is to be grafted on
	- sometimes, you may need to create the directory if it does not already exist
![[Pasted image 20250604222542.png]]
	- ==WARNING==: If you mount a filesystem on a non-empty directory, the former contents of that directory are covered-up and not accessible until the filesystem is unmounted. Thus, mount points are usually empty directories
- ==Mounting and Unmounting==:
	- =="mount"== command:
		- used to attach a filesystem (which can be local to the computer or on a network) somewhere within the filesystem tree
		- the basic arguments are the device node and mount point
		- eg. $ sudo mount /dev/sda5 /home
			- this will attach the filesystem contained in the disk partition associated with the /dev/sda5 device node into the filesystem tree at the /home mount point
		- there are other ways to specify the partition other than the device node, such as using the disk label or UUID (Universally Unique IDentifier)
		- executing mount without any arguments will show all presently mounted filesystems
	- =="umount"== command:
		- used to unmount a partition (note, umount not unmount)
		- only a root user (logged in as root, or using sudo) has the privilege to run these commands, unless the system has been otherwise configured
	- if you want a filesystem to be ==automatically available every time the system starts up==, you need to ==edit /etc/fstab== accordingly (the name is short for filesystem table)
		- looking at this file will show you the configuration of all pre-configured filesystems
		- "man fstab" will display how this file is used and how to configure it
	- =="df -Th"== command:
		- will display info about mounted filesystems, including the filesystem type, and usage statistics about currently used and available space
		- tmpfs filesystems are parts of system memory that are represented as such to take advantage of certain programming features
## NFS and Network Filesystems
- it is often necessary to share data across physical systems which may be either in the same location or anywhere that can be reached by the internet
	- a network (also sometimes called distributed) filesystem may have all its data on one machine or have it spread out on more than one network node
		- a variety of different filesystems can be used locally on individual machines; a network filesystem can be thought of as a grouping of lower-level filesystems of varying type
- many system administrators mount remote users' home directories on a server in order to give them access to the same files and configuration files across multiple client systems
	- this allows the users to log in to different computers, yet still have access to the same files and resources
- the most common such filesystem is named simply NFS (Network Filesystem)
	- it has a very long history and was first developed by Sun Microsystems
	- another common implementation is CIFS (also termed SAMBA), which has Microsoft roots
###  ==NFS on the Server==:
- on the server machine, NFS uses daemons (built-in networking and service processes in Linux) and other system servers are started at the command line by typing:
	- $ sudo systemctl start nfs
	- ==NOTE==: on some systems, such as RHEL/CentOS, and Fedora, the service is now called ==nfs-server==, not nfs
- the text file "/etc/exports" contains the directories and permissions that a host is willing to share with other systems over NFS
	- a very simple entry in this file may look like the ff:
		- /projects \*.example.com(rw)
		- this entry allows the directory /projects to be mounted using NFS with read and write (rw) permissions and shared with other hosts in the example.com domain
		- ==NOTE==: every file in Linux has 3 possible permissions:
			- read (r)
			- write (w)
			- execute (x)
- after modifying "/etc/exports" file, you can type "exportfs -av" to notify Linux about the directories you are allowing to be remotely mounted using NFS
	- you can also restart NFS with "sudo systemctl restart nfs", but this is heavier, as it halts NFS for a short while before starting it up again
- to make sure the NFS service starts whenever the system is booted, issue:
	- $ sudo systemctl enable nfs
### ==NFS on the Client==:
- on the client machine, if it is desired to have the remote filesystem mounted automatically upon system boot, "/etc/fstab" is modified to accomplish this.
- eg. an entry in the client's "/etc/fstab" might look like the ff:
	- servername:/projects /mnt/nfs/projects nfs defaults 0 0
- you can also mount the remote filesystem without a reboot or as a one-time mount by directly using the "mount" command:
	- $ sudo mount servername:/projects /mnt/nfs/projects
- ==NOTE==: if "/etc/fstab" is not modified, this remote mount will not be present the next time the system is restarted. Furthermore, you may want to use the nofail option in fstab in case the NFS server is not live at boot


## Filesystem Layouts
### ==User Home Directories==
- each user has a home directory, usually placed under /home
- the /root directory on modern Linux systems is no more than the home directory of the root user (or superuser or system administrator account)
- on multi-user systems, the /home directory infrastructure may be mounted as a separate filesystem on its own partition or even exported (shared) remotely on a network through NFS
- sometimes, you may group users based on their department or function
	- you can then create subdirectories under the /home directory for each of these groups
		- eg. a school may organize /home with something like the ff:
			- /home/faculty/
			- /home/staff/
			- /home/students/
### ==/bin and /sbin Directories
- the /bin directory contains ==executable binaries==, ==essential commands used to boot the system== or in single-user mode, and ==essential commands required by all system users==, such as cat, cp, ls, mv, ps, and rm
- likewise, the /sbin directory is intended for ==essential binaries related to system administration==, such as fsck and ip
	- to view a list of these programs, type:
		- $ ls /bin /sbin
- commands that are not essential (theoritically) for the system to boot or operate in single-user mode are placed in the /usr/bin and /usr/sbin directories
	- historically, this was done so /usr could reside on a separate filesystem that could be mounted at a later stage of system startup or even over a network
	- however, nowadays most find this distinction to be obsolete. In fact, many distributions have been discovered to be unable to boot with this separation, as this modality had not been used or tested for a long time
	- thus, on most Linux distros today, /usr/bin and /bin are actually just symbolically linked together, as are /usr/sbin and /sbin, so there are really just two directories, not four
### ==/proc filesystem==
- certain filesystems, like the one mounted at /proc, are called pseudo-filesystems because they have no actual permanent presence anywhere on the disk
- the /proc filesystem contains ==virtual files (files that exist only in memory) that permit viewing constantly changing kernel data==
- /proc contains files and directories that mimic kernel structures and configuration info
- it does not contain real files, but runtime system info, like system memory, devices mounted, hardware configuration
- some important entries in /proc are:
	- /proc/cpuinfo
	- /proc/interrupts
	- /proc/meminfo
	- /proc/mounts
	- /proc/partitions
	- /proc/version
- /proc has subdirectories as well, including:
	- /proc/\<Process-ID-#\>
	- /proc/sys
- the /proc filesystem is very useful because the info it reports is gathered only as needed and never needs storage on the disk
### ==/dev directory==
- the /dev directory contains ==device nodes==, a type of pseudo-file used by most hardware and software devices, except for network devices
- this directory is:
	- empty on the disk partition when it is not mounted
	- contains entries which are created by the udev system, which creates and manages device nodes on Linux, creating them dynamically when devices are found
- this directory contains items such as:
	- /dev/sda1 (first partition on the first hard disk)
	- /dev/lp1 (second printer)
	- /dev/random (a source of random numbers)
### ==/var directory==
- the /var directory contains ==files that are expected to change in size and content as the system is running== (var stands for variable), such as the entries in the ff directories:
	- system log files: /var/log
	- packages and database files: /var/lib
	- print queues: /var/spool
	- temporary files: /var/tmp
- the /var directory may be put on its own filesystem so that growth of the files can be accommodated and any exploding file sizes do not fatally affect the system
- network services directories such as /var/ftp (the FTP server) and /var/www (the HTTP web service) are also found under /var
### ==/etc directory==
- the /etc directory is the ==home for system configuration files==
- it contains no binary programs, although there are some executable scripts
	- eg. "/etc/resolv.conf" tells the system where to go on the network to obtain host name to IP address mappings (DNS)
- files like passwd, shadow and group for managing user accounts are found here
- while some distros have historically had their own extensive infrastructure under /etc (eg. Red Hat and SUSE have used /etc/sysconfig), with the advent of systemd there is much more uniformity among distros today
- ==NOTE==: /etc is for system-wide configuration files and only the superuser can modify files there. User-specific configuration files are always found under their home directory
### ==/boot directory
- the /boot directory contains the ==few essential files needed to boot the system==
- for every alternative kernel installed on the system, there are four files:
	- vmlinuz
		- the compressed Linux kernel, required for booting
	- initramfs
		- the initial ram filesystem, required for booting, sometimes called initrd, not initramfs
	- config
		- the kernel configuration file, only used for debugging and bookkeeping
	- System.map
		- kernel symbol table, only used for debugging
	- each of these files has a kernel version appended to its name
- the Grand Unified Bootloader (GRUB) files such as /boot/grub/grub.conf or /boot/grub2/grub2.cfg are also found here
### ==/lib and /lib64 directories
- /lib contains ==libraries== (common code shared by applications and needed for them to run) for the ==essential programs in /bin and /sbin==
- these library filenames either ==start with ld or lib==
	- eg. /lib/libncurses.so.5.9.
- most of these are what is known as dynamically loaded libraries (also known as shared libraries or Shared Objects (SO))
- on some Linux distros there exists a /lib64 directory containing 64-bit libraries, while /lib contains 32-bit versions
- just like /bin and /sbin, the directories point to those under /usr
- kernel modules (kernel code, often device drivers, that can be loaded and unloaded without re-starting the system) are located in /lib/modules/\<kernel-version-number\>
### ==Removable media: the /media, /run and /mnt directories
- one often uses removable media, such as USB drives, CDs and DVDs. To make the material accessible through the regular filesystem, it has to be mounted at a convenient location
- most Linux systems are configured so any removable media are automatically mounted when the system notices something has been plugged in
- while historically, this was done under the ==/media directory==, modern Linux distros place these mount points under ==/run directory==
	- eg. a USB pen drive with a label myusbdrive for a user named student would be mounted at /run/media/student/myusbdrive
- the ==/mnt== directory has been used since the early days of UNIX for temporarily mounting filesystems. 
	- these can be those removable media, but more often might be ==network filesystems==, which are not normally mounted
	- or these can be ==temporary partitions==, or so-called ==loopback filesystems==, which are files which pretend to be partitions
### ==Additional directories under root==

| DIRECTORY NAME | USAGE                                                                                                                                         |

| /tmp           | Temporary files; on some distros erased across a reboot and/or may actually be a ramdisk in memory                                            |
| /usr           | Multi-user applications, utilities and data                                                                                                   |
|                |                                                                                                                                               |
### ==/usr Directory Tree==
 - the /usr directory tree contains theoretically non-essential programs and scripts (in the sense that they should not be needed to initially boot the system) and has at least the ff. sub-directories:

| DIRECTORY NAME | USAGE                                                                                                       |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| /usr/include   | Header files used to compile applications                                                                   |
| /usr/lib       | Libraries for programs in /usr/bin and /usr/sbin                                                            |
| /usr/lib64     | 64-bit libraries for 64-bit programs in /usr/bin and /usr/sbin                                              |
| /usr/sbin      | Non-essential system binaries, such as system daemons, and scripts                                          |
| /usr/share     | Shared data used by applications, generally architecture-independent                                        |
| /usr/src       | Source code, usually for the Linux kernel                                                                   |
| /usr/local     | Data and programs specific to the local machine; subdirectories include bin, sbin, lib, share, include, etc |
| /usr/bin       | This is the primary directory of executable programs and scripts                                            |
## Comparing Files and File Types
### diff
- used to compare files and directories
- many useful options, including:
	- "-c": provides a listing of differences that include three lines of context before and after the lines differing in content 
	- "r": used to recursively compare subdirectories, as well as the current directory
	- "-i": ignore the case of letters
	- "-w": ignore differences in spaces and tabs (white space)
	- "-q": be quiet - only report if files are different without listing the differences
- Syntax: ==diff \[options\] \<filename1\>\<filename2\>==
- "diff" is meant to be used for text files
	- for binary files, one can use "cmp"
- if preferred, there are multiple graphical interfaces to diff, including:
	- diffuse, vimdiff, and meld
### diff3
- compare three files at once
- Syntax: diff3 MYFILE COMMONFILE YOURFILE
### patch
- many modifications to source code and configuration files are distributed utilizing patches
- a patch file contains the deltas (changes) required to update an older version of a file to a new one
- the ==patch files are actually produced== by running diff with the correct options, as in:
	- ==$ diff -Nur originalfile newfile > patchfile==
- distributing just the patch is more concise and efficient than distributing the entire file
	- eg. if only one line needs to change in a file that contains 1000 lines, the patch file will be just a few lines long
- to ==apply a patch==, you can just do either of the two methods below:
	- $ ==patch -p1 < patchfile==
	- $ ==patch originalfile patchfile==
	- the first usage is more common, as it is often used to apply changes to an entire directory tree, rather than just one file, as in the second example
### file utility
- in Linux, a file's extension does not, by default, categorize its nature the way it might in other operating systems
	- eg. one cannot assume that a file named file.txt is a text file and not an executable program
- in Linux, a filename is generally more meaningful to the user of the system than the system itself
	- in fact, most applications directly examine a file's contents to see what kind of object it is rather than relying on an extension
	- this is very different from the way Windows handles filenames, where a filename ending with ".exe", for example, represents an executable binary file
- the real nature of a file can be ascertained by using the "file" utility.
- for the file names given as arguments, it examines the contents and certain characteristics to determine whether the files are plain text, shared libraries, executable programs, scripts, or something else
## Backing Up and Compressing Data
- there are many ways you can back up data or even your entire system
- basic ways to do so include the use of simple ==copying with "cp" ==and use of the ==more robust "rsync"==
- both can be used to synchronize entire directory trees
	- however, =="rsync" is more efficient==, because it ==checks if the file being copied already exists==
	- if it exists and there is no change in size or modification time, "rsync" will avoid an unnecessary copy and save time
	- furthermore, because "rsync" copies only the parts of files that have actually changed, it can be very fast
	- =="cp" can only copy files to and from destinations on the local machine (unless you are copying to or from a filesystem mounted using NFS)==
	- but "rsync" can also be used to copy files from one machine to another
		- locations are designated in the "target:path" form, where target can be in form of "someone@host"
		- the "someone@" part is optional and used if the remote user is different from the local user
	- "rsync" is very efficient when recursively copying one directory tree to another, because only the differences are transmitted over the network
	- one often synchronizes the destination directory tree with the origin, using the "-r" option to recursively walk down the directory tree copying all files and directories below the one listed as the source
### Using rsync
- "rsync" is a very powerful utility
- eg. a very useful way to back up a project directory might be to use the ff. command:
	- $ rsync -r project-X archive-machine:archives/project-X
- note that rsync can be very ==destructive!==
	- accidental misuse can do a lot of harm to data and programs, by inadvertently copying changes to where they are not wanted
	- ==take care to specify the correct options and paths==
	- it is highly recommended that you first test your "rsync" command using the "--dry-run" option to ensure that it provides the results that you want
- to use "rsync" at the command prompt, type "'==rsync sourcefile destinationfile==", where either file can be on the local machine or on a networked machine
	- the contents of sourcefile will be copied to destinationfile
- a good combination of options is shown in:
	- $ rsync --progress -avrxH --delete sourcedir destdir
### Compressing data
- file data is often compressed to save disk space and reduce the time it takes to transmit files over networks
- Linux uses a number of methods to perform this compression, including:
	- ==gzip==: 
		- the most frequently used Linux compression utility
	- ==bzip2==: 
		- produces files significantly smaller than those produced by gzip
	- ==xz==: 
		- the most space-efficient compression utility used in Linux
	- ==zip==: 
		- is often required to examine and decompress archives from other OS
- these techniques vary in the efficiency of the compression (how much space is saved) and in how long they take to compress
	- generally, the ==more efficient techniques take longer==
	- decompression time does not vary as much across different methods
- in addition, the "tar" utility is often used to group files in an archive and then compress the whole archive at once
### gzip
- "gzip" has historically been the most widely used Linux compression utility
- it compresses well and is very fast
- the ff. provides some usage examples:
	- "gzip \*":
		- compresses all files in the current directory
		- each file is compressed and renamed with a ".gz" extension
	- "gzip -r projectX":
		- compresses all files in the projectX directory, along with all files in all of the directories under projectX
	- "gunzip foo":
		- de-compresses foo found in the file "foo.gz"
		- under the hood, the "gunzip" command is actually the same as "gzip -d"
### bzip2
- "bzip2" has a syntax that is similar to gzip but:
	- it uses a different compression algorithm and produces significantly smaller files
	- at the price of taking a longer time to do its work
	- thus, it is more likely to be used to compress larger files
- examples of common usage are also similar to "gzip":
	- "bzip2 \*":
		- compresses all the files in the current directory
		- and replaces each file with a file renamed with a ".bz2" extension
	- "bunzip2 \*.bz2":
		- decompresses all of the files with an extension of ".bz2" in the current directory
		- under the hood, "bunzip2" is the same as calling "bzip2 -d" 
- ==NOTE==: "bzip2" has lately become deprecated due to lack of maintenance and the superior compression ratios of "xz" (which is actively maintained). While it should no longer be used for compressing files, you are likely to still need it to decompress files you encounter with the bz2 extension.
### xz
- "xz" is the most space-efficient compression utility frequently used in Linux and is the choice for distributing and storing "archives of the Linux kernel"
- once again, it trades a slower compression speed for an even higher compression ratio
- it is gradually becoming the dominant compression method, especially for large files which may need to be downloaded from the Internet
- common usage examples:
	- "xz \*":
		- compresses all files in the current directory
		- and replaces each file with one with a ".xz" extension
	- "xz foo":
		- compresses foo into "foo.xz" using the default compression level (-6), 
		- and removes foo if compression succeeds
	- "xz -dk bar.xz":
		- decompresses bar.xz into bar
		- and does not remove bar.xz even if decompression is successful
	- "xz -dcf a.txt b.txt.xz": > abcd.txt
		- decompresses a mix of compressed and uncompressed files to standard output, using a single command
	- "xz -d \*":
		- decompresses the files compressed using xz
- compressed files are stored with a ".xz" extension
### zip
- while the "zip" program is rarely used to compress files in Linux
	- it may be needed to examine and decompress archives from other operating systems
- it is only used in Linux when you get a zipped file from a Windows user or environment or from Internet downloads
- it is a legacy program
- it is neither fast nor efficient
- common usage examples:
	- "zip backup \*":
		- compresses all files in the current directory and places them in the "backup.zip"
	- "zip -r backup.zip ~":
		- archives your login directory (~) and all files and directories under it in "backup.zip"
	- "unzip backup.zip":
		- extracts all files in backup.zip and places them in the current directory
### tar
- historically, "tar" stood for "tape archive" and was used to archive files to a magnetic tape
- it allows you to create or extract files from an archive file, often called a "tarball"
- at the same time, you can optionally compress while creating the archive, and decompress while extracting its contents
- common usage examples:
	- "tar xvf mydir.tar":
		- extract all the files in mydir.tar into the mydir directory
	- "tar zcvf mydir.tar.gz mydir":
		- create the archive and compress with gzip
	- "tar jcvf mydir.tar.bz2 mydir":
		- create the archive and compress with bzip2
	- "tar Jcvf mydir.tar.xz mydir":
		- create the archive and compress with xz
	- "tar xvf mydir.tar.gz":
		- extract all the files in mydir.tar.gz into the mydir directory
		- ==NOTE==: you do not have to tell tar it is in gzip format
- use of a dash (-) before options is often done, although it is usually unnecessary
	- as in: "tar -xvf mydir.tar"
- you can separate out the archiving and compression stages, as in:
	- $ tar cvf mydir.tar mydir ; gzip mydir.tar
	- $ gunzip mydir.tar.gz ; tar xvf mydir.tar
	- but this is slower and wastes space by creating an unneeded intermediary .tar file
### Relative Compression Times and Sizes
- to demonstrate the relative efficiency of gzip, bzip2, and xz
	- the ff. screenshot shows the results of compressing a purely text file directory tree (the include directory from the kernel source) using the three methods
	- ![[Pasted image 20250607042346.png]]
	- this shows that as compression factors go up, CPU time does as well (ie. producing smaller archives takes longer)
### Disk-to-Disk Copying (dd)
- the "dd" program is very useful for making copies of raw disk space
	- eg. to back up your Master Boot Record (MBR) (the first 512-byte sector on the disk that contains a table describing the partitions on that disk), you might type:
		- dd if=/dev/sda of=sda.mbr bs=512 count=1
		- ==WARNING==:
			- Typing: dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb
			- to make a copy of one disk onto another, will delete everything that previously existed on the second disk
			- an exact copy of the first disk device is created on the second disk device
			- ==Do not experiment with this command as written above, as it can erase a hard disk==
- exactly what the name "dd" stands for is an often-argued item
	- the words "data definition" is the most popular theory and has roots in early IBM history
	- often, people joke that it means "disk destroyer" and other variants such as "delete data"
