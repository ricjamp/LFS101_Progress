- Use and configure user accounts and user groups.
- Use and set environment variables.
- Use the previous shell command history.
- Use keyboard shortcuts.
- Use and define aliases.
- Use and set file permissions and ownership.
# Accounts, Users and Groups
## Identifying the Current User
- as you know, Linux is a multi-user OS, meaning more than one user can log on at the same time
- to identify the ==current user==, type =="whoami"== 
- to list the ==currently logged-on users==, type =="who"==
	- giving "who" the "-a" option will give more detailed information
## User Startup Files
- in Linux, the command shell program (generally bash) uses one or more startup files to configure the user environment
- files in the /etc directory define global settings for all users, while initialization files in the user's home directory can include and/or override the global settings
- the startup files can do anything the user would like to do in every command shell, such as:
	- customizing the prompt
	- defining command line shortcuts and aliases
	- setting the default text editor
	- setting the path for where to find executable programs
## Order of the Startup Files
- the standard prescription is that when you first login to Linux, /etc/profile is read and evaluated, after which the ff. files are searched (if they exist) in the listed order:
	1. ~/.bash_profile
	2. ~/.bash_login
	3. ~/.profile
	- where "~/" denotes the user's home directory
- the Linux login shell evaluates whatever startup file that it comes across first and ignores the rest
- this means that if it finds "~/.bash_profile", it ignores "~/.bash_login" and "~/.profile"
- different distributions may use different startup files
- however, every time you create a new shell, or terminal window, etc., you do not perform a full system login
	- only a file named "~/.bashrc" file is read and evaluated
	- although this file is not read and evaluated along with the login shell, most distributions and/or users include the "~/.bashrc" file from within one of the three user-owned startup files
- most commonly, users only fiddle with "~/.bashrc", as it is invoked every time a new command line shell initiates, or another program is launched from a terminal window, while the other files are read and executed only when the user first logs onto the system
- recent distributions sometimes do not even have ".bash_profile" and/or ".bash_login", and some just do little more than include ".bashrc"
## Creating Aliases
- you can create ==customized commands== or ==modify the behavior== of already existing ones by creating aliases
- most often, these aliases are ==placed in your "~/.bashrc"== file so they are available to any command shells you create
- =="unalias"== removes an alias
- typing "alias" with no arguments will list currently defined aliases
- please note there should not be any spaces on either side of the equal sign and the alias definition needs to be placed within either single or double quotes if it contains any spaces
## Basics of Users and Groups
- all Linux users are assigned a unique user ID (uid)
	- which is just an integer
	- normal users start with a uid of 1000 or greater
- Linux uses groups for organizing users
	- groups are collections of accounts with certain shared permissions
	- they are used to establish a set of users who have common interests for the purposes of access rights, privileges, and security considerations
	- access rights to files (and devices) are granted on the basis of the user and the group they belong to
- control of group membership is administered through the "/etc/group" file, which shows the list of groups and their members
	- by default, every user belongs to a default (primary) group
	- when a user logs in, the group membership is set for their primary group, and all the members enjoy the same level of access and privilege
	- permissions on various files and directories can be modified at the group level
- users also have one or more group IDs (gid), including a default one that is the same as the user ID
- these numbers are associated with names through the files "/etc/passwd" and "/etc/group"
### Adding and Removing Users
- distributions have straightforward graphical interfaces for creating and removing users and groups, and manipulating group membership
- however, it is often useful to do it from the command line or from within shell scripts
- ==only the root user can add and remove users and groups==
- adding a new user is done with =="useradd"== and removing an existing user is done with =="userdel"==
- in the simplest form, an account for the new user bjmoose would be done with:
	- $ sudo useradd bjmoose
	- which, by default, sets the home directory to "/home/bjmoose", populates it with some basic files (copied from /etc/skel) and adds a line to /etc/passwd such as:
		- bjmoose:x:1002:1002::/home/bjmoose:/bin/bash
			- and sets the default shell to /bin/bash
- removing a user account is as easy as typing "userdel bjmoose"
	- however, this will leave the /home/bjmoose directory intact
		- this might be useful if it is a temporary inactivation
	- to remove the home directory while removing the account, one needs to use the "-r" option to userdel
- typing "id" with no argument gives information about the current user, as in:
	- $ id
	- uid=1002(bjmoose) gid=1002(bjmoose) groups=106(fuse),1002(bjmoose)
- if given the name of another user as an argument, "id" will report information about that other user
### Adding and Removing Groups
- adding a new group is done with =="groupadd"==:
	- $ sudo /usr/sbin/groupadd anewgroup
- the group can be removed with =="groupdel"==:
	- $ sudo /usr/sbin/groupdel anewgroup
- adding a user to an already existing group is done with =="usermod"==
	- eg. you would first look at what groups the user already belongs to:
		- $ groups rjsquirrel
			- rjsquirrel : rjsquirrel
	- and then add the new group:
		- $ sudo /us/sbin/usermod -a -G anewgroup rjsquirrel
		- $ groups rjsquirrel
			- rjsquirrel: rjsquirrel anewgroup
- these utilities update /etc/group as necessary
- ==make sure to use the "-a" option (for append) to avoid removing already existing groups==
- =="groupmod"== can be used to change group properties, such as:
	- the Group ID (gid) with the "-g" option
	- or, its name with "-n" option
- removing a user from the group is somewhat trickier
	- the "-G" option to usermod must give a complete list of groups:
		- $ sudo /usr/sbin/usermod -G rjsquirrel rjsquirrel
		- $ groups rjsquirrel
			- rjsquirrel : rjsquirrel
		- note the lack of the "-a" option
## the root account
- the root account is very powerful and has full access to the system
	- other OSs often call this the administrator account
	- it is often called the superuser account
- you must be extremely cautious before granting full root access to a user
	- it is rarely, if ever, justified
	- external attacks often consist of tricks used to elevate to the root account
- however, you can use "sudo" to assign more limited privileges to user accounts:
	- only on a temporary basis
	- only for a specific subset of commands
### su and sudo
- when assigning elevated privileges, you can use the command "su" (switch or substitute user) to launch a new shell running as another user (you must type the password of the user you are becoming)
	- most often, this other user is root, and the new shell allows the use of elevated privileges until it is exited
	- it is almost always a bad (dangerous for both security and stability) practice to use "su" to become root
	- resulting errors can include deletion of vital files from the system and security breaches
- granting privileges using "sudo" is less dangerous and is preferred
	- by default, "sudo" must be enabled on a per-user basis
		- however, some distributions (such as Ubuntu) enable it by default for at least one main user, or give this as an installation option
### Elevating to root account
- to temporarily become the superuser for a series of commands, you can type "su" and then be prompted for the root password
- to execute just one command with root privilege, type "sudo \<command\>"
	- when the command is complete, you will return to being a normal unprivileged user
- "sudo" configuration files are stored in the "/etc/sudoers" file and in the /"etc/sudoers.d/" directory
	- by default, the "sudoers.d" directory is empty
# Environment Variables
- Environment variables are quantities that have specific values which may be utilized by the command shell, such as bash, or other utilities and applications
- some environment variables are given preset values by the system (which can usually be overridden), while others are set directly by the user, either at the command line or within startup and other scripts
- an environment variable is actually just a character string that contains information used by one or more application
- there are a number of ways to view the values of currently set environment variables
	- one can type:
		- =="set"==
		- =="env"==
		- =="export"==
	- depending on the state of your system, "set" may print out many more lines than the other two methods
## Setting Environment Variables
- by default, variables created within a script are only available to the current shell
	- child processes (sub-shells) will not have access to values that have been set or modified
	- allowing ==child processes to see the values== requires use of the =="export"== command
- example tasks:
	- echo $SHELL
		- show the value of a specific variable (in this case, SHELL)
	- export VARIABLE=value (or VARIABLE=value; export VARIABLE)
		- export a new variable value
	- adding a variable permanently
		- edit "~/.bashrc" and add the line "export VARIABLE=value"
		- type "source ~/.bashrc" or just ". ~/.bashrc"
			- or just start a new shell by typing "bash"
- you can also set environment variables to be fed as a one shot to a command as in:
	- $ SDIRS="s_0\*" KROOT=/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build make modules_install
	- which feeds the values of the SDIRS and KROOT environment variables to the command "make modules_install"
## HOME Variable
- "HOME" is an environment variable that represents the ==home (or login) directory of the user==
- "cd" without arguments will change the current working directory of the value of "HOME"
- Note the tilde character (~) is often used as an abbreviation for $HOME
	- thus, "cd $HOME" and "cd ~" are completely equivalent statements
## PATH Variable
- "PATH" is an ==ordered list of directories (the path)== which is scanned when a command is given to find the appropriate program or script to run
- each directory in the path is separated by colons (:)
- a null (empty) directory name (or ./) indicates the current directory at any given time
	- :path1:path2
		- there is a null directory before the first colon (path1)
	- path1::path2
		- there is a null directory between path1 & path2
- to prefix a private "bin" directory to your path:
	- $ export PATH=\$HOME/bin:\$PATH
	- echo $PATH
## SHELL Variable
- the environment variable "SHELL" points to the user's default command shell (the program that is handling whatever you type in a command window, usually bash) and contains the full pathname to the shell:
- $ echo $SHELL
	- /bin/bash
## PS1 Variable and the Command Line Prompt
- Prompt Statement (PS) is used to customize your prompt string in your terminal windows to display the information you want
- "PS1" is the primary variable which controls what your command line prompt looks like
- the ff. special characters can be included in "PS1":
	- \u - User name
	- \h - Host name
	- \w - Current Working Directory
	- \\! - History number of this command 
	- \d - Date
- they must be surrounded in single quotes when they are used, as in the ff. example:
	- $ echo $PS1
		- \[\u@\h \W\]\$
	- $ export PS1='\u@\h:\w$ '
		- student@example.com~$
- to the revert the changes:
	- $ export PS1='$ '
- an even better practice would be to save the old prompt first and then restore, as in:
	- $ OLD_PS1=$PS1
	- change the prompt, and eventually change it back with:
	- export PS1=$OLD_PS1
- one can get quite fancy with the prompt and do things like add colors or even sounds
## Recalling Previous Commands
- "bash" keeps track of previously entered commands and statements in a history buffer
- you can recall previously used commands simply by using the Up and Down cursor keys
- type =="history"== to view the list of previously executed commands
	- the list of commands is displayed with the most recent command appearing last in the list
	- this information is stored in ~/.bash_history
	- if you have multiple terminals open, the commands typed in each session are not saved until the session terminates
### Using History Environment Variables
- several associated environment variables can be used to get information about the history file:
	- HISTFILE
		- the location of the history file
	- HISTFILESIZE
		- the maximum number of lines in the history file (default 500)
	- HISTSIZE
		- the maximum number of commands in the history file
	- HISTCONTROL
		- how commands are stored
	- HISTIGNORE
		- which command lines can be unsaved
### Finding and Using Previous Commands
- specific keys to perform various tasks:
	- Up/Down arrow keys
		- browse through the list of commands previously executed
	- !! (pronounced as bang-bang)
		- execute the previous command
	- CTRL-R
		- search previously used commands
- if you want to recall a command in the history list, but do not want to press the arrow key repeatedly, you can press CTRL-R to do a reverse intelligent search
	- as you start typing, the search goes back in reverse order to the first command that matches the letters you have typed
	- by typing more successive letters, you make the match more and more specific
### Executing Previous Commands
- the ff. describes the syntax used to execute previously used commands:
	- !
		- start a history substitution
	- !$
		- refer to the last argument in a line
	- !n
		- refer to the nth command line
	- !string
		- refer to the most recent command starting with string
- all history substitutions start with '!'
	- when typing the command: "ls -l /bin /etc /var"
	- !$ will refer to /var, the last argument to the command
- more examples:
	- $ history
		- 1. echo $SHELL
		- 2. ls -l /etc/ passwd
		- 3. sleep 1000
		- 4. history
	- !1 refers to echo $SHELL
	- !sle refers to sleep
### Keyboard Shortcuts
- you can use keyboard shortcuts to perform different tasks quickly
- the ff. table lists some of these keyboard shortcuts and their uses:
	- note: the case of the hotkey does not matter; CTRL-a is the same as CTRL-A
	- note: some applications will override these usages; emacs has other ideas for CTRL-S and CTRL-U

| SHORTCUT | TASK                                                                  |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CTRL-L   | Clears the screen                                                     |
| CTRL-S   | Temporarily halt output to the terminal window                        |
| CTRL-Q   | Resume output to the terminal window                                  |
| CTRL-D   | Exits the current shell                                               |
| CTRL-Z   | Puts the current process into suspended background and back to prompt |
| CTRL-C   | Kills the current process                                             |
| CTRL-H   | Works the same as backspace                                           |
| CTRL-A   | Goes to the beginning of the line                                     |
| CTRL-W   | Deletes the word before the cursor                                    |
| CTRL-U   | Deletes from beginning of line to cursor position                     |
| CTRL-E   | Goes to the end of the line                                           |
| Tab      | Auto-completes files, directories, and binaries                       |
# File Permissions
## File Ownership
- in Linux and other UNIX-based OSs, every file is associated with a user who is the owner
- every file is also associated with a group (a subset of all users) which has an interest in the file and certain rights, or permissions: read, write, and execute
- the ff. utility programs involve user and group ownership and permission setting:
	- "chown"
		- used to change user ownership of a file or directory
	- "chgrp"
		- used to change group ownership
	- "chmod"
		- used to change the permissions on the file
		- which can be done separately for owner, group and the rest of the world (often named as other)
## File Permissions Mode and chmod
- files have three kinds of permissions:
	- read (r)
	- write (w)
	- execute (x)
- these are generally represented as in "rwx"
- these permissions affect three groups of owners:
	- user/owner (u)
	- group (g)
	- others (o)
- as a result, you have the ff. three groups of three permissions:
	- rwx: rwx: rwx
	- u: g: o
- there are a number of different ways to use "chmod"
	- for instance, to give the owner and others execute permission and remove the group write permission:
		- $ ls -l somefile
		- -rw-rw-r-- 1 student student 1601 Mar 9 15:04 somefile
		- $ chmod uo+x, g-w somefile
		- $ ls -l somefile
		- -rwxr--r-x 1 student student 1601 Mar 9 15:04 somefile
	- where u stands for user (owner), o stands for other (world), and g stands for group
- this kind of syntax can be difficult to type and remember, so one often uses a shorthand which lets you set all the permissions in one step
	- this is done with a simple algorithm, and a single digit suffices to specify all three permission bits for each entity
	- this digit is the sum of:
		- 4 - if read permission is desired
		- 2 - if write permission is desired
		- 1 - if executed permission is desired
	- thus, 7 means read/write/execute, 6 means read/write, and 5 means read/execute
- when you apply this to the "chmod" command, you have to give three digits for each degree of freedom, such as in:
	- $ chmod 755 somefile
	- $ ls -l somefile
	- -rwxr-x-r-x 1 student student 1601 Mar 9 15:04 somefile
## Examples of chown
- let's see an example of changing file ownership using "chown", as shown in the screenshot below
- ![[Pasted image 20250611034444.png]]
- First, we create two empty files
	- notice it requires sudo to change the owner of file2 to root
	- the second "chown" command changes both owner and group at the same time
	- finally, only the superuser can remove the files
## Example of chgrp
- now, let's see an example of changing the group ownership using "chgrp":
	- ![[Pasted image 20250611035221.png]]
