# Learning Objectives
## Identify Linux filesystems.
- Different Types supported by Linux:
	- ==Conventional disk==: ext3, ext4, XFS, Btrfs, JFS, NTFS, vfat, exfat, etc.
	- ==Flash storage==: ubifs, jffs2, yaffs, etc.
	- ==Database filesystems==
	- ==Special purpose==: procfs, sysfs, tmpfs, squashfs, debugfs, fuse, etc.
## Identify the differences between partitions and filesystems.
- ==Partitions:==
	- dedicated subsection of physical media storage
	- a container where a filesystem resides
- ==Filesystem:==
	- method of storing and accessing files
	- can span more than one partition when using "symbolic links"
- ==Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)==
	- Linux systems store their important files according this standard
	- standard maintained by the Linux Foundation
	- designed to ensure Linux users can move between distros without having to re-learn how the system is organized
	- '/' character is used to separate paths
	- filesystem names are case-sensitive
		- /boot, /Boot and /BOOT are three (3) different directories

|                                  | WINDOWS     | LINUX             |
| -------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------------- |
| Partition                        | Disk1       | /dev/sda1         |
| Filesystem type                  | NTFS/VFAT   | EXT3/EXT4/XFS/... |
| Mounting parameters              | DriveLetter | MountPoint        |
| Base folder (where OS is stored) | C:\         | /                 |
## Describe the boot process.
![[Pasted image 20250527011914.png]]
1. Starts with ==powering on== the device
2. ==BIOS== (Basic Input/Output System)
	- POST (Power On Self Test)
		- hardware is initialized
		- main memory is tested
	- BIOS software is stored in a ROM chip on the motherboard. After POST, the remainder of the boot process is controlled by the OS
3. ==Boot Loader==
	- Common Linux boot loaders:
		- GRUB (GRand Unified Boot loader)
		- ISOLINUX (for booting from removable media)
		- DAS U-Boot (for booting on embedded devices/appliances)
	- usually stored on the system's storage devices (HDD or SSD), either in the boot sector (BIOS/MBR-Master Boot Record) or the EFI partition (EFI/UEFI systems-(United) Extensible Firmware Interface)
	- Most Linux boot loaders can present a UI for choosing alternative options for booting Linux and even other OS that might be installed
	- the boot loader is responsible for loading the kernel image and the initial RAM disk or filesystem into memory
	- ==BIOS/MBR==
		- the boot loader resides at the first sector of the hard disk (aka MBR) - First 512 bytes
		- boot loader examines the partition table and finds a ==bootable partition==
		- once found, it searches for the ==2nd stage boot loader ==(like GRUB), which is then loaded into RAM
	- ==EFI/UEFI==
		- UEFI firmware reads its ==Boot Manager== data to determine which UEFI application is to be launched and from where (ie: which disk and partition the EFI partition can be found)
		- the firmware then launches the ==UEFI application== (like GRUB) as defined in the boot entry in the firmware's boot manager
		- more complicated but more versatile than the MBR method
	- ==2nd Stage Boot Loader==
		- resides under /boot
		- a splash screen is displayed, which allows us to choose which OS and/or kernel to boot
		- after OS & kernel are selected, the boot loader loads the kernel of the OS into RAM and passes control to it
	- ==CMOS== (battery that keeps track of system date & time even when your device is powered off) contains the values of the date, time, and most important peripherals 
	- Kernels are ==almost always compressed==, so the ==first job they have is to uncompress themself==, then it will check and analyze the system hardware and initialize any hardware device drivers built into the kernel
	- The boot loader ==loads both the kernel and an initial RAM–based file system== (initramfs) into memory, so it can be used directly by the kernel.
	- When the kernel is loaded in RAM, it immediately initializes and configures the computer’s memory and also configures all the hardware attached to the system. This includes all processors, I/O subsystems, storage devices, etc. The kernel also loads some necessary user space applications.
4. ==Initial RAM Disk==
	- the ==initramfs== filesystem image contains programs and binary files that perform actions needed to:
		- mount the proper root filesystem
		- provide the kernel functionality required for the specific filesystem that will be used
		- figure out which devices are present (locate them)
		- locate the device drivers they need to operate properly, and load them. 
	- after the root filesystem has been found, it is checked for errors and mounted.
	- the mount program instructs the OS that a filesystem is ready for use and associates it with a particular point in the overall hierarchy of the filesystem (the mount point). 
	- if this is successful, the initramfs is cleared from RAM and the init program on the root filesystem (/sbin/init) is executed
	- init handles the mounting and pivoting over to the final real root filesystem. If special hardware drivers are needed before the mass storage can be accessed, they must be in the initramfs image.
	- init also starts the text-mode login prompts
		- if on a GUI system, you will see that instead, although the text terminals can be accessed with keyboard shortcuts (usually Function keys + ctrl-alt)
		- bash will be the default shell for most distros

5. ==/sbin/init== (parent process)
	- once the kernel has set up all its hardware and mounted the root filesystem, the kernel runs /sbin/init
	- this becomes the initial process, which then starts other processes to get the system running. Most other processes on the system trace their origin ultimately to init; exceptions include the so-called kernel processes
	- init is also responsible for keeping the system running and for shutting it down cleanly
		- acts when necessary as a manager for all non-kernel processes
			- it cleans up after them upon completion
			- restarts user login services as needed when users log in and out
			- does the same for other background system services
6. ==systemd==
	- takes advantage of parallel processing compared to the older SysVinit startup system
	- /sbin/init now points to /lib/systemd/systemd ==(systemd takes over the init process)==
	- example systemd command: ==systemctl==
		- to start / stop / restart a service, eg. (httpd = Apache web server)
			- ==sudo systemctl start | stop | restart httpd.service==
		- to enable or disable a system service from starting up at system boot
			- ==sudo systemctl enable | disable httpd.service==
		- to check on the status of a service
			- ==sudo systemctl status httpd.service==
		- ==Note==: in most cases, the ".service" can be omitted
## Install Linux on a computer.
### Questions to ask when choosing a distro
- What is the main function of the system (server or desktop)?
- What types of packages are important to the organization?
	- eg. word processing, web servers, etc
- How much storage space is required, and how much is available?
	- eg. Linux embedded device installation is space constrained
- How often are packages updated?
- How long is the support cycle for each release?
	- Long Term Support (LTS)
- Do you need kernel customization from the vendor or a third party?
- What hardware are you running on?
	- eg. x85, RISC-V, ARM, PPC, etc
- Do you need long-term stability? 
	- Or can you accept (or need) a more volatile cutting-edge system running the latest software versions?
### Installed Environments
- Running Debian on Windows WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux 2)
- Running centOS Stream 9 on Virtual Box 7.12
	- make sure to update before installing Guest Additions
