## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
- Describe what a process is and distinguish between types of processes.
- Enumerate process attributes.
- Manage processes using **ps** and **top**.
- Understand the use of load averages and other process metrics.
- Manipulate processes by putting them in background and restoring them to foreground.
- Use **at**, **cron**, and **sleep** to schedule processes in the future or pause them.
# Processes
- an ==instance of one or more related tasks== (threads) executing on your computer
- not the same as a program or command. A single command may start several processes simultaneously
- some processes are independent of each other and others are related
- a failure of one process may or may not affect the others running on the system
- processes use many system resources like RAM, CPU cycles, peripheral devices, etc
- the OS (esp. the kernel) is responsible for allocating a proper share of these resources to each process and ensuring overall optimized system utilization
## Process Types

| Process<br>Type          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Examples                               |

| Interactive<br>Processes | Need to be started by a user, either at a command line or through a GUI such as an icon or a menu selection                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | bash, firefox, top, Slack, LibreOffice |
| Batch<br>Processes       | Automatic processes which are scheduled from and then disconnected from the terminal. These tasks are queued and work on a FIFO (First-In, First-Out) basis                                                                                                                                                                                                  | updatedb, ldconfig                     |
| Daemons                  | Server processes that run continuously. Many are launched during system startup and then wait for a user or system request indicating that their service is required. Naming convention with last letter d                                                                                                                                                   | httpd, sshd, libvirtd, cupsd           |
| Threads                  | Lightweight processes. These are tasks that run under the umbrella of a main process, sharing memory and other resources, but are scheduled and run by the system on an individual basis. An individual thread can end without terminating the whole process and a process can create new threads at any time. Many non-trivial programs are multi-threaded. | dconf-service, gnome-terminal-server   |
| Kernel Threads           | Kernel tasks that users neither start nor terminate and have little control over. These may perform actions like moving a thread from one CPU to another, or making sure input/output operations to disk are completed                                                                                                                                       | kthreadd, migration, ksoftirqd         |
## Process Scheduling and States
- a critical kernel function called a ==scheduler== constantly shifts processes on and off the CPU, sharing time according to:
	- relative priority
	- how much time is needed
	- how much has already been granted to a task
- when a process is in a so-called ==running state==, it means it is either currently executing instructions on a CPU, or is waiting to be granted a share of time (a time slice) so it can execute.
- all processes in this state reside on what is a called a ==run queue== and on a computer with multiple CPUs, or cores, there is a run queue on each.
- as noted, the word running is a little misleading as the process may actually be swapped out, waiting its turn to get back in the race
- however, sometimes processes go into what is called a ==sleep state==, generally when they are waiting for something to happen before they can resume, perhaps for the user to type something. In this condition, a process is said to be sitting in a wait queue.
- there are other less frequent process states, esp. when a process is terminating. 
- Sometimes, a child process completes, but its parent process has not asked about its state.
- such a process is said to be in a ==zombie state==; it is not really alive, but still shows up in the system's list of processes 
## Process and Thread IDs
- at any given time, there are always multiple processes being executed.
- the OS keeps track of them by assigning each a ==unique process ID (PID) number==
- the PID is used to track:
	- process state
	- CPU usage
	- memory use
	- precisely where resources are located in memory
	- other characteristics
- new PIDs are usually assigned in ==ascending order== as processes are born. Thus, PID 1 denotes the init process (system initialization process), and succeeding processes are gradually assigned higher numbers
- ID Types:
	- ==Process ID (PID)==: 
		- unique process ID number
	- ==Parent Process ID (PPID)==: 
		- process (Parent) that started this process.
		- if the parent dies, the PPID will refer to an adoptive parent; on modern kernels, this is kthreadd which has PPID=2
	- ==Thread ID (TID)==: 
		- thread ID number
		- this is the same as the PID for single-threaded processes
		- for a multi-threaded process, each thread shares the same PID, but has a unique TID
## Terminating a Process (hasta la vista, baby)
- at some point, one of your applications may stop working properly. How do you eliminate it?
- to terminate a process, you can type "==kill -SIGKILL \<pid\>"== or =="kill -9 \<pid\>=="
- however, you can only kill your own processes; those belonging to another user are off-limits unless you are root (the name kill is historical and somewhat misleading; the command can be used to send any kind of signal to process, not just a termination one)
## User and Group IDs
- many ==users can access a system simultaneously==, and ==each user can run multiple processes==.
- the ==OS identifies the user== who starts the process ==by the Real User ID== (RUID) assigned to the user
- the user ==who determines the access rights== for the users is ==identified by the Effective UID (EUID)==
	- the EUID may or may not be the same as the RUID
- users can be organized into enumerated groups
	- each group is identified by the ==Real Group ID (RGID)==
	- the ==access rights of the group== are determined by the ==Effective Group ID (EGID)==
	- each user can be a member of one or more groups
- mostly, we ignore these details and just talk about the User ID (UID) and Group ID (GID)
## More about Priorities
- at any given time, many processes are running (ie. in the run queue) on the system.
- however, a CPU can actually accommodate only one task at a time, just like a car can have only one driver at a time.
- some processes are more important than others, so Linux allows you to set and manipulate ==process priority==
	- Higher priority processes get preferential access to the CPU
- the priority for a process can be set by specifying a ==nice value==, or ==niceness==, for the process
	- the ==lower the nice value, the higher the priority==
	- low values are assigned to important processes, while high values are assigned to processes that can wait longer
	- a process with a high nice value simply allows other processes to be executed first
- In Linux, a nice value of ==-20 represents the highest priority== and ==+19 represents the lowest==.
- nice Output
	- you can also assign a so-called real-time priority to time-sensitive tasks, such as controlling machines through a computer or collecting incoming data
	- this is just a very high priority and is not to be confused with what is called hard real-time, which is conceptually different and has more to do with making sure a job gets completed within a very well-defined time window
- renice \<value\> \<ID\> command:
	- change the priority of a process ID (default), Process group (PGID) or User (UID)
	- change to values will include child processes, and likewise processes owned by User
	- lowering the nice value requires sudo, while increasing niceness does not require sudo
## Load Averages
- the load average is the average of the load number for a given period of time
- it takes into account processes that are:
	- ==actively running on the CPU==
	- considered ==runnable==, but waiting on the run queue for a CPU to become available
	- ==sleeping==: ie. waiting for some kind of resource (typically, I/O) to become available
- ==Note==: Linux differs from other UNIX-like OS in that it includes the sleeping processes. Furthermore, it only includes so-called uninterruptible sleepers, those which cannot be awakened easily.
- the load average can be ==viewed by running "w", "top", or "uptime"==
- ==Interpreting Load Averages==:
	- the load average is displayed using three numbers:
		- ==1st==: For the ==last minute== the system has been % utilized on average
			- eg. 0.45 means 45% utilization in the last minute
		- ==2nd==: For the ==last 5 minutes== utilization has been %
			- eg. 0.15 means 15% util (on average) over the past 5 minutes
		- ==3rd==: For the ==last 15 minutes== utilization has been %
			- eg. 1.00 means 100% util (on average) over the past 15 minutes
				- could indicate a heavy workload
		- for ==multi-core CPUs==, this number is ==divided by the number of cores==
			- eg. for a Quad (4) core CPU, 4.00 would mean 100% util
	- short-term increases are usually not a problem. A high peak you see is likely a burst of activity, not a new level.
		- eg. at start up, many processes start and then activity settles down.
	- if a high peak is seen in the 5 and 15 minute load averages, it may be cause for concern
## Background and Foreground Processes
- Linux supports background and foreground job processing
- a job in this context is just a command launched from a terminal window
- ==foreground jobs run directly from the shell==
	- when one foreground job is running, other jobs need to wait for shell access (at least in that terminal window if using the GUI) until it is completed
	- this is fine when jobs complete quickly but this can have an adverse effect if the current job is going to take a long time (even several hours) to complete
	- in such cases, you can run the job in the background and free the shell for other tasks
- ==background jobs will be executed at lower priority==, which:
	- will allow smooth execution of the interactive tasks
	- and you can type other commands in the terminal window while the background job is running
- ==by default, all jobs are executed in the foreground==
	- you can put a job in the ==background by suffixing '&'== to the command
		- eg. $ updatedb &
- ==Ctrl + Z==: suspend a foreground job (ie. put it in background)
- ==Ctrl + C==: terminates a foreground job
- =="bg" command==: run a suspended process in the background (as if it was started with &)
- =="fg" command==: run a background process in the foreground
## Managing Jobs
- =="jobs" command==: 
	- displays all jobs running in background
	- the display shows the job ID, state, and command name
	- =="-l" option==: adds the PID of the background jobs
	- the background jobs are connected to the terminal, so, if you log off, the jobs utility will not show the ones started from that window
## ps Command (System V Style)
- ps (Process Status):
	- provides info about currently running processes keyed by PID
	- if you want a periodic update of this status: 
		- you can use "top" or other commonly installed variants (htop, atop, btop) from the command line
		- or invoke your distro's graphical system monitor application (such as gnome-system-monitor or ksysguard)
- "ps" has many options:
	- specifying exactly which tasks to examine
	- what info to display about them
	- precisely what output format should be used
- without options, "ps" will display all processes running under the current shell.
- =="-u" option==: display info of processes for a specified username
- =="-ef" option==: displays all the processes in the system in full detail
- =="-eLF" option==: displays one line of info for every thread (more in-depth than "-ef")
	- remember: a process can contain multiple threads
## ps Command (BSD Style)
- "ps" has another style of option specification, which stems from the BSD variety of UNIX
- in this style, options are specified without preceding dashes
- =="ps aux"==: displays all processes of all users
- =="ps axo"==: allows you to specify which attributes you want to view
## The Process Tree
- =="pstree"== command: 
	- displays the processes running on the system in the form of a tree diagram showing the relationship between a process and its parent process and any other processes that it created.
	- repeated entries of a process are not displayed, and threads are displayed in curly braces.
## top Command
- while a static view of what the system is doing is useful, monitoring the system performance live over time is also valuable.
- one option would be to run ps at regular intervals, say, every few seconds.
- a better alternative is to use "top" to get ==constant-real time updates== (every 2 seconds by default)
- ==exit by typing q==
- "top" clearly highlights which processes are consuming the most CPU cycles and memory (using appropriate commands from within top)
- the ==first line of the top output== displays a quick summary of what is happening in the system, including:
	- how long the system has been up
	- how many users are logged on
	- what is the average load
- the ==second line of the top output== displays:
	- the total number of processes
	- the number of running, sleeping, stopped, and zombie processes.
- comparing the number of running processes with the load average helps determine if the system has reached its capacity or perhaps a particular user is running too many processes
- the stopped processes should be examined to see if everything is running correctly
- the ==third line of the top output== indicates:
	- how the CPU time is being divided between the users (us) and the kernel (sy) by displaying the percentage of CPU time used for each
	- the percentage of user jobs running at a lower priority (niceness - ni)
	- idle mode (id) should be low if the load average is high, and vice versa
	- the percentage of jobs waiting (wa) for I/O is listed
	- interrupts include the percentage of hardware (hi) vs. software (si)
	- steal time (st) is generally used with virtual machines, which has some of its idle CPU time taken for other uses
- the ==fourth and fifth lines== of the top output indicate:
	- memory usage, which is divided into 2 categories:
		- Physical memory (RAM) - displayed on line 4
		- Swap space - displayed on line 5
		- both categories display total memory, used memory, and free space
- you need to monitor memory usage very carefully to ensure good system performance
- once the physical memory is exhausted, the system starts using swap space (temporary storage space on the hard drive) as an extended memory pool, and since accessing disk is much slower than accessing memory, this will negatively affect system performance
- if the system starts using swap often, you can add more swap space. However, adding more physical memory should also be considered
- ==process list of the top output==
	- each line in the process list of the top output displays info about a process
	- by default, processes are ordered by highest CPU usage
	- the ff. info about each process is displayed:
		- PID - Process ID number
		- USER - Process Owner
		- PR - Priority, NI - Nice Values
		- VIRT - Virtual, RES - Physical, SHR - Shared Memory
		- S - Status
		- %CPU - Percentage of CPU, %MEM - Memory Used
		- TIME+ - Execution Time
		- COMMAND - Command
- ==interactive keys with top==
	- besides reporting info, "top" can be utilized interactively for monitoring and controlling processes
	- while top is running in a terminal window, you can enter single-letter commands to change its behavior
	- eg. 
		- you can view the top-ranked processes based on CPU or memory usage
		- if needed, you can alter the priorities of running processes or you can stop/kill a process (some alterations require sudo)
	- ==press 'h' or '?' to see a list of keys==
	- ==most of these interactive keys are toggles==; hitting them a second time reverts to the original display
## Scheduling/Starting Future Processes
- =="at" utility program==:
	- suppose you need to perform a task on a specific day sometime in the future
		- however, you know you will be away from the machine on that day
			- how will you perform the task?
	- you can use the "at" utility program to execute any non-interactive command at a specified time
- =="cron" utility program==:
	- is a time-based scheduling utility program
	- it can launch routine background jobs at specific times and/or days on an ongoing basis
	- "cron" is driven by a configuration file called "/etc/crontab" (cron table), which contains the various shell commands that need to be run at the properly scheduled times
	- there are both system-wide crontab files and individual user-based ones
	- each line of a crontab file represents a job, and is composed of a so-called "CRON" expression, followed by a shell command to execute
	- typing "crontab -e" will open the crontab editor to edit existing jobs or to create new jobs
	- each line of the crontab file will contain 6 fields:
		- MIN - Minutes - 0 to 59
		- HOUR - Hour field - 0 to 23
		- DOM - Day Of Month - 1 to 31
		- MON - Month field - 1 to 12
		- DOW - Day Of Week - 0 to 6 (0 = Sunday)
		- CMD - Command - any command to be executed
	- eg.
		- "* * * * * /usr/local/bin/execute/this/script.sh" will schedule a job to execute script.sh every minute of every hour of every day of the month, and every month and every day in the week
		- "30 08 10 06 * /home/sysadmin/full-backup" will schedule a full-backup at 8:30 AM, 10th of June, regardless of the day of the week
- =="anacron"==:
	- while "cron" has been used in UNIX-like OSs for decades, modern Linux distros have moved over to a newer facility: "anacron"
		- this was because "cron" implicitly assumed the machine was always running
			- however, if the machine was powered off, scheduled jobs would not run
	- "anacron" will run the necessary jobs in a controlled and staggered manner when the system is up and running
	- the key configuration file is "/etc/anacrontab"
	- ==Note==: anacron still makes use of the cron infrastructure for submitting jobs on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis, but it defers running them until opportune times when the system is actually alive
- =="sleep"==:
	- sometimes, a command or job must be delayed or suspended.
		- suppose, for example, an application has read and processed the contents of a data file and then needs to save a report on a backup system.
		- if the backup system is currently busy or not available, the application can be made to sleep (wait) until it can complete its work
		- such a delay might be to mount the backup device and prepare it for writing
		- an even simpler and frequent case is one where a system process needs to run periodically to take care of any work that has been queued up for it to deal with and then has to lurk in the background until it is needed again
	- "sleep" suspends execution for at least the specified period of time, which can be given as the number of seconds (the default), minutes, hours, or days.
	- after that time has passed (or an interrupting signal has been received), execution will resume
	- the syntax is:
		- sleep NUMBER\[SUFFIX\] ...
		- where SUFFIX may be:
			- s for seconds (default), m for minutes, h for hours, d for days
	- ==NOTE==: "sleep" and "at" are quite different; =="sleep" delays execution== for a specific period, while =="at" starts execution== at a specific designated later time
