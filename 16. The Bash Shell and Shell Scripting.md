# Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
- Explain the features and capabilities of bash shell scripting.
- Know the basic syntax of scripting statements.
- Be familiar with various methods and constructs used.
- Test for properties and existence of files and other objects.
- Use conditional statements, such as if-then-else blocks.
- Perform arithmetic operations using scripting language.
# Shell Scripting
- suppose you want to look up a filename, check if the associated file exists, and then respond accordingly, displaying a message confirming or not confirming the file's existence
	- if you only need to do it once, you can just type a sequence of commands at a terminal
- however, if you need to do this multiple times, automation is the way to go
- in order to automate sets of commands, you will need to learn how to write shell scripts
- most commonly in Linux, these scripts are developed to be run under the bash command shell interpreter
- ==Features of Shell Scripts==:
	- automate tasks and reduce risk of errors
	- combine long and repetitive sequences of commands into one simple command
	- share procedures among several users
	- provide a controlled interface to users
	- create new commands using combination of utilities
	- quick prototyping, no need to compile
# Command Shell Choices
- the command interpreter is tasked with executing statements that follow it in the script
- commonly used interpreters include:
	- /usr/bin/perl, /bin/bash, /bin/csh, /usr/bin/python, /bin/sh
- typing a long sequence of commands at a terminal window can be complicated, time consuming, and error prone
- by deploying shell scripts, using the command line becomes an efficient and quick way to launch complex sequences of steps
- the fact that shell scripts are saved in a file also makes it easy to use them to create new script variations and share standard procedures with several users
- Linux provides a wide choice of shells; exactly what is available on the system is listed in "/etc/shells". Typical choices are:
	- /bin/sh
	- /bin/bash
	- /bin/tcsh
	- /bin/csh
	- /bin/ksh
	- /bin/zsh
- most Linux users use the default bash shell, but those with long UNIX backgrounds with other shells may want to override the default
