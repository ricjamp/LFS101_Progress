# Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
- Explain the features and capabilities of bash shell scripting.
- Know the basic syntax of scripting statements.
- Be familiar with various methods and constructs used.
- Test for properties and existence of files and other objects.
- Use conditional statements, such as if-then-else blocks.
- Perform arithmetic operations using scripting language.
# Features and Capabilities
## Shell Scripting
- suppose you want to look up a filename, check if the associated file exists, and then respond accordingly, displaying a message confirming or not confirming the file's existence
	- if you only need to do it once, you can just type a sequence of commands at a terminal
- however, if you need to do this multiple times, automation is the way to go
- in order to automate sets of commands, you will need to learn how to write shell scripts
- most commonly in Linux, these scripts are developed to be run under the bash command shell interpreter
- ==Features of Shell Scripts==:
	- automate tasks and reduce risk of errors
	- combine long and repetitive sequences of commands into one simple command
	- share procedures among several users
	- provide a controlled interface to users
	- create new commands using combination of utilities
	- quick prototyping, no need to compile
## Command Shell Choices
- the command interpreter is tasked with executing statements that follow it in the script
- commonly used interpreters include:
	- /usr/bin/perl, /bin/bash, /bin/csh, /usr/bin/python, /bin/sh
- typing a long sequence of commands at a terminal window can be complicated, time consuming, and error prone
- by deploying shell scripts, using the command line becomes an efficient and quick way to launch complex sequences of steps
- the fact that shell scripts are saved in a file also makes it easy to use them to create new script variations and share standard procedures with several users
- Linux provides a wide choice of shells; exactly what is available on the system is listed in "/etc/shells". Typical choices are:
	- /bin/sh
	- /bin/bash
	- /bin/tcsh
	- /bin/csh
	- /bin/ksh
	- /bin/zsh
- most Linux users use the default bash shell, but those with long UNIX backgrounds with other shells may want to override the default
## Shell Scripts
- a shell is simply a ==command line interpreter== which provides the user interface for terminal windows
- a command shell can also be used to run scripts, even in non-interactive sessions without a terminal window, as if the commands were being directly typed in
	- eg. typing "find . -name "\*.c" -ls" at the command line accomplishes the same thing as executing a script file containing the lines:
		- \#\!/bin/bash
		- find . -name "\*c" -ls
			- the first line of the script, which starts with "#!", contains the full path of the command interpreter (in this case /bin/bash) that is to be used on the file
			- there are quite a few choices for the scripting language you can use, such as:
				- /usr/bin/perl
				- /usr/bin/python
				- /bin/csh
			- the special two-character sequence "#!", is often called a "shebang", and avoids the usual rule that the pound sign '#', delineates the ff. text as a comment
### A Simple bash Script
- let's write a simple bash script that displays a one line message on the screen:
	- $ cat > hello.sh
	- #!/bin/bash
	- echo "Hello, Student"
	- or just create hello.sh in your favorite text editor
	- run the script file by:
		- making it executable through "chmod +x hello.sh", then "./hello.sh"
		- "bash hello.sh"
### Interactive Example using bash Scripts
- now, let's see how to create a more interactive example using a bash script
- the user will be prompted to enter a value, which is then displayed on the screen
	- the value is stored in a temporary variable, name
		- we can reference the value of a shell variable by using a $ in front of the variable name, such as $name
- to create this script, you need to create a file named getname.sh in your favorite editor with the following content:
	- #!/bin/bash  
	- \# Interactive reading of a variable  
	- echo "ENTER YOUR NAME"  
	- read name  
	- \# Display variable input  
	- echo "The name given was :$name"
## Return values
- all shell scripts generate a return value upon finishing execution
	- which can be explicitly set with the "exit" statement
- return values permit a process to monitor the exit state of another process
	- often in a parent-child relationship
- knowing how the process terminates enables taking any appropriate steps which are necessary or contingent on success or failure
### Viewing Return values
- as a script executes
	- one can check for a specific value or condition
		- and return success or failure as the result
- by convention
	- success is returned as zero (0)
	- failure is returned as any non-zero value
- any easy way to demonstrate success and failure completion is to execute the "ls" program on a file that exists, as well as one that does not
- the ==return value is stored in the environment variable represented by $?==:
	- $ ls /etc/logrotate.conf
	- /etc/logrotate.conf
	- $ echo $?
	- 0
	- in this example, the system is able to locate the file "/etc/logrotate.conf" and "ls" returns a value of 0 to indicate success
	- when run on a non-existing file, it returns 2
- applications often translate these return values into meaningful messages easily understood by the user
- usually, the specific values that can be returned and their meanings are explained in the man page for the program
# Syntax
## Basic Syntax and Special Characters
- scripts require you to follow a standard language syntax
- rules delineate how to define variables and how to construct and format allowed statements
- the table lists some special character usages within bash scripts:

| CHAR | DESC                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| \#   | used to add a comment, except when used as \# or as #! when starting a script                                                                                              |
| \\   | used at the end of a line to indicate continuation on to the next line, or to indicate that the next character is to be interpreted literally (escape character), as in \$ |
| \;   | used to interpret what follows as a new command to be executed after completion of the current command                                                                     |
| \$   | indicates what follows is an environment variable                                                                                                                          |
| \>   | redirect output                                                                                                                                                            |
| \>\> | append output                                                                                                                                                              |
| <    | redirect input                                                                                                                                                             |
| \|   | used to pipe the result into the next command                                                                                                                              |
## Splitting Long Commands over Multiple Lines
- sometimes, commands are too long to either easily type on one line, or to grasp and understand
	- even though there is no real practical limit to the length of a command line
- in this case, the concatenation operator '\\', the backslash character, is used to continue long commands over several lines
- here is an example of a command installing a long list of packages on a system using Debian package management:
	- $~/> cd $HOME
	- $~/> sudo apt install autoconf automake bison build-essential \
	-          chrpath curl diffstat emacs flex gcc-multilib g++-multilib
	- the command is divided into multiple lines to make it look readable and easier to understand
	- the '\\' operator at the end of each line causes the shell to continue (concatenate) multiple lines and execute them as one single command
## Putting Multiple Commands on a Single Line
- users sometimes need to combine several commands and statements and even conditionally execute them based on the behavior of operators used in between them
	- this method is called =="chaining of commands"==
- there are several ways to do this, depending on what you want to do:
	- the =='\;' (semicolon) character is used to separate these commands and execute them sequentially==, as if they had been typed on several lines
		- each ensuing command is executed whether or not the preceding one succeeded
		- the three commands in the ff. example will all execute, even if the ones preceding them fail:
			- $ make ; make install ; make clean
	- however, you may want to ==abort subsequent commands when an earlier one fails==
		- you can do this ==using the "&&" (and) operator==, as in:
			- $ make && make install && make clean
		- if the first command fails, the second one will never be executed
	- a final refinement is to ==use the "||" (or) operator==, as in:
		- $ cat file1 || cat file2 || cat file3
		- in this case, you ==proceed until something succeeds and then you stop executing any further steps==
- chaining commands is not the same as piping them 
	- in the latter, succeeding commands begin operating on data streams produced by earlier ones before they complete
	- while in chaining, each step exits before the next one starts
## Output Redirection
- most OSs accept input from the keyboard and display the output on the terminal
- however, with shell commands and scripts, you can send the output to a file
	- the ==process of diverting the output to a file== is called "output redirection"
- the =='>' character== is used to write output to a file
- eg. the ff. command sends the output of "free" to "/tmp/free.out":
	- $ free > /tmp/free.out
	- use "cat" to check the contents of "/tmp/free.out"
- two '>' characters (ie. >>) will append output to a file if it exists, and act just like '>' if the file does not already exist
## Input Redirection
- just as the output can be redirected to a file, the input of a command can be read from a file
- the process of reading input from a file is called "input redirection" and uses the '<' character
- the ff. three commands (using "wc" to count the number of lines, words and characters in a file) are entirely equivalent and involve input redirection, and a command operating on the contents of a file:
	- $ wc < /etc/passwd
	- $ wc /etc/passwd
	- $ cat /etc/passwd | wc
## Built-in Shell Commands
- shell scripts execute sequences of commands and other types of statements
- these commands can be:
	- compiled applications
	- built-in bash commands
	- shell scripts or scripts from other interpreted languages, such as perl and Python
- compiled applications are binary executable files, usually residing on the filesystem in well-known directories such as /usr/bin
- shell scripts always have access to applications in the default path, such as:
	- rm, ls, df, vi, and gzip
		- which are programs compiled from lower-level programming languages such as C
- in addition, bash has many built-in commands, which can only be used to display the output within a terminal shell or shell script
	- sometimes, these commands have the same name as executable programs on the system, which can lead to subtle problems
	- these built-in commands include:
		- cd, pwd, echo, read, logout, printf, let, time, and ulimit
	- thus, slightly different behavior can be expected from the built-in version of a command such as "echo" as compared to /bin/echo
- a complete list of bash built-in commands can be found in the bash man page, or by simply typing "help"
## Script Parameters
- users often need to pass parameter values to a script, such as a filename, date, etc
- scripts will take different paths or arrive at different results according to the parameters (command arguments) that are passed to them
- these values can be text or numbers as in:
	- $ ./script.sh /tmp
	- $ ./script.sh 100 200
- within a script, the parameter or an argument is represented with a '$' and a number or special character
- the table lists some of these parameters

| PARA        | MEAN                         |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- |
| $0          | script name                  |
| $1          | first parameter              |
| $2, $3, etc | second, third parameter, etc |
| $*          | all parameters               |
| $#          | number of arguments          |
### Using Script Parameters
![[Pasted image 20250617203517.png]]
- if you type in the script shown in the figure, make the script executable
- then, run the script giving it several arguments, as shown
- the script is processed as follows:
	- $0 prints the script name: param.sh
	- $1 prints the first parameter: one
	- $2 prints the second parameter: two
	- $3 prints the third parameter: three
	- $* prints all the parameters: one two three four five
	- the final statement becomes: All done with param.sh
## Command Substitution
- at times, you may need to substitute the result of a command as a portion of another command
- it can be done in two ways:
	- by enclosing the inner command in $()
	- by enclosing the inner command with backticks (')
	- ==NOTE==: the second form using backticks is deprecated, and its use should be avoided in new scripts and commands
- no matter which method is used, the specified command will be executed in a newly launched shell environment and the standard output of the shell will be inserted where the command substitution is done
- virtually any command can be executed this way
- while both of these methods enable command substitution
	- the ==$() method allows command nesting==
	- while the use of backticks does not because the right and left delimiters are identical
	- new scripts should always use this more modern method
- eg.
	- $ ls /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/
	- in the above example, the output of the command "uname -r" (which will be something like 6.2.4) is inserted into the argument for the "ls" command
## Environment Variables
- most scripts use variables containing a value, which can be used anywhere in the script
	- these variables can either be user or system-defined
		- many applications use such environment variables for supplying inputs, validation, and controlling behavior
- some examples of standard environment variables are HOME, PATH, and HOST
	- when referenced, environment variables must be prefixed with the '$' symbol, as in $HOME
- you can ==view and set the value of environment variables==
	- eg. the ff. command displays the value stored in the PATH variable:
		- $ echo $PATH
- however, ==no prefix is required when setting or modifying the variable value==
	- eg. the ff. command sets the value of the MYCOLOR variable to blue
		- $ MYCOLOR=blue
- you can get a list of environment variables with the "env", "set", or "printenv" commands
## Exporting Variables
- while we discussed the export of environment variables in the section on the "User Environment", it is worth reviewing in the context of writing bash scripts
- by default, the ==variables created within a script are available only to the subsequent steps of that script==
	- ==any child processes (sub-shells) do not have automatic access to the values of these variables==
- to ==make them available to child processes==, they must be ==promoted to environment variables using the export statement==, as in:
	- $ export VAR=value
	- or, VAR=value ; export VAR
- while ==child processes are allowed to modify the value of exported variables==, the ==parent will not see any changes==
	- ==exported variables are not shared, they are only copied and inherited==
- typing "export" with no arguments will give a list of all currently exported environment variables
## Functions
- a function is a ==code block that implements a set of operations==
- functions are useful for executing procedures multiple times, perhaps with varying input variables
- functions are also often called ==subroutines==
- using functions in scripts requires two steps:
	- declaring a function
	- calling a function
- the function declaration requires a name which is used to invoke it
	- the proper syntax is:
		- function_name () {
		     command...
		 }
	- eg. the ff. function is named display:
		- display () {
			 echo "This is a sample function that just displays a string"
		 }
- the function can be as long as desired and have many statements
- once defined, the function can be called later as many times as necessary
# Constructs
## if Statement
- conditional decision making, using an "if" statement , is a basic construct that any useful programming or scripting language must have
- when an "if" statement is used, the ensuing actions depend on the evaluation of specified conditions, such as:
	- numerical or string comparisons
	- return value of a command (0 for success)
	- file existence or permissions
- in compact form, the syntax of an "if" statement is:
	- if TEST-COMMMANDS; then CONSEQUENT-COMMANDS; fi
- a more general definition is:
	- if condition
	- then
		- statements
	- else
		- statements
	- fi
### using the if statement
- in the ff. example, an "if" statement checks to see if a certain file exists, and if the file is found, it displays a message indicating success or failure:
	- if \[ -f "$1"\ ]
	- then
		- echo "file $1 exists"
	- else
		- echo "file $1 does not exist"
	- fi
- we really should also check first that there is an argument passed to the script ($1) and abort if not
- notice the use of the square brackets ( \[ \] ) to delineate the test condition
- there are many other kinds of tests you can perform, such as checking whether two numbers are equal to, greater than, or less than each other and make a decision accordingly
- in modern scripts, you may see doubled brackets as in ( \[\[ -f /etc/passwd \]\] )
	- this is not an error
	- it is never wrong to do so and it avoids some subtle problems, such as referring to an empty environment variable without surrounding it in double quotes
### elif Statement
- you can use the "elif" statement to perform more complicated tests, and take appropriate actions
- the basic syntax is:
	- if \[ sometest \]; then
		- statement
	- elif \[ someothertest \]; then
		- statement
	- fi
## Testing for Files
- bash provides a set of file conditionals that can be used with the "if" statement, including those in the table
- you can use the "if" statement to test for file attributes, such as:
	- file or directory existence
	- read or write permission
	- executable permission
- eg.
	- if \[ -x /etc/passwd \]; then
		- ACTION
	- fi
	- this checks if the file "/etc/passwd" is executable, which it is not
	- ==NOTE== the very common practice of putting "; then" on the same line as the "if" statement
- you can view the full list of file conditions (and other test conditions) in:
	- ==man 1 test==
## Boolean Expressions
- Boolean expressions evaluate to either TRUE or FALSE, and results are obtained using the various Boolean operators listed in the table
- "&&" Operator
	- AND: the action will be performed only if both the conditions evaluate to true
- "||" Operator
	- OR: the action will be performed if any one of the conditions evaluate to true
- '!' Operator
	- NOT: the action will be performed only if the condition evaluates to false
- note that if you have multiple conditions strung together with the "&&" operator, processing stops as soon as a condition evaluates to false
	- eg. A && B && C
		- A is true but B is false, C will never be executed
- likewise, if you are using the "||" operator, processing stops as soon as anything is true
	- eg. A || B || C
		- A is false and B is true, you will also never execute C
### Tests in Boolean Expressions
- Boolean expressions return either TRUE or FALSE
- we can use such expressions when working with multiple data types, including strings or numbers, as well as with files
- eg. to check if a file exists, use the ff. conditional test:
	- \[ -e \<filename\> \]
- similarly, to check if the value of number1 is greater than the value of number2, use the ff. conditional test:
	- \[ $number1 -gt $number2 \]
	- the operator "-gt" returns TRUE if number1 is greater than number2
### Example of Testing in Strings
- you can use the "if" statement to compare strings using the "\=\=" operator (two equal signs)
- the syntax is as follows:
	- if \[ string1 \=\= string2 \]; then
		- ACTION
	- fi
	- ==NOTE==: using one equal sign (\=) will also work, but some consider it deprecated usage
## Numerical Tests
- you can use specially defined operators with the "if" statement to compare numbers
- the various operators that are available are listed below:
	- "-eq": equal to
	- "-ne": not equal to
	- "-gt": greater than
	- "-lt": less than
	- "-ge": greater than or equal to
	- "-le": less than or equal to
- the syntax for comparing numbers is as follows:
	- exp1 -op exp2
### Example of Testing for Numbers
![[Pasted image 20250618233513.png]]
## Arithmetic Expressions
- arithmetic expressions can be evaluated in the ff. three ways (==spaces are important==):
	- "expr" utility:
		- "expr" is a standard but somewhat deprecated program
		- expr 8 + 8
		- echo $(expr 8 + 8)
		- 16
	- $((...)) syntax:
		- this is the built-in shell format
		- echo $((8+1))
		- 9
	- "let" command:
		- let x=( 1 + 2 ); echo $x
		- 3
- in modern shell scripts, the use of "expr" is better replaced with var=$((...))
# Labs 16.1 - Simple Calculator
Write a script that will act as a simple calculator for add, subtract, multiply and divide.
1. Each operation should have its own function.
2. Any of the three methods for bash arithmetic, (**$((..))**, **let**, or **expr**) may be used.
3. The user should give 3 arguments when executing the script:  
    - The first should be one of the letters **a**, **s**, **m**, or **d** to specify which math operation.  
    - The second and third arguments should be the numbers that are being operated on.
4.  The script should detect for bad or missing input values and display the results when done.
## My Solution
$ vim simplecalc.sh
\#!/bin/bash
\# check for bad or missing input values
number_check='^\[0-9\]+$'
letter_check='^\[asmd\]$
if \[\[ $# -ne 3 \]\]; then
	echo "Please enter only 3 arguments"
	exit
elif \[\[ ! $1 =~ $letter_check \]\]; then
	echo "First argument should be a, s, m or d"	
	exit
elif \[\[ ! $2 =~ $number_check \]\] || \[\[ ! $3 =~ $number_check \]\]; then
	echo "Second and Third arguments must be an integer"
	exit
fi
\# do calculations
add_them () {
	echo "$(( $1 + $2 ))"
}
sub_them () {
	echo "$(( $1 - $2 ))"
}
mul_them () {
	echo "$(( $1 *+* $2 ))"
}
div_them () {
	echo "$(( $1 / $2 ))"
}
if \[\[ $1 == "a" \]\]; then
	add_them $2 $3
elif \[\[ $1 == "s" \]\]; then
	sub_them $2 $3
elif \[\[ $1 == "m" \]\]; then
	mul_them $2 $3
elif \[\[ $1 == "d" \]\]; then
	div_them $2 $3
fi

==NOTE==: 
- functions cannot access environment variables, do either of the ff. to make it work:
	- pass the value of the environment variables to the function
	- declare a new variable with the value of the environment variable
	- export the environment variables (ie. export myvar=$2)
