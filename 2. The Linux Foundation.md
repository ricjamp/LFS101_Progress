# Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

- Discuss the role of the Linux Foundation.
	- brings together linux development, either through providing training, hosting events, or as a platform for collaboration
- Appreciate the learning opportunities provided by the Linux Foundation's training program.
- Describe the software environment required for this course.
	- need a linux distro
		- distros are built because they fill a need (and some funny niche distros exist)
- Describe the three major Linux distribution families.
	- Red Hat Family Systems (CentOS & Fedora)
	- SUSE (openSUSE)
	- Debian (Ubuntu & Linux Mint)

# Red Hat Family
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)
	- Fedora
		- serves as an ==upstream testing platform== for RHEL
	- CentOS
		- close clone of RHEL; part of Red Hat since 2014
- a heavily patched version 4.18 kernel is used in RHEL/CentOS 8 Stream,
- while version 5.14 is used in RHEL/CentOS 9 Stream
- supports multiple hardware platforms
- uses dnf, the RPM-based package manager to install, update, and remove packages in the system
- RHEL is widely used by enterprises which host their own systems
# SUSE Family (SOO-SUH)
- SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES)
	- ==upstream for openSUSE==
- the relationship between SLES and openSUSE is similar to RHEL, CentOS, and Fedora.
- openSUSE is available to end users at not cost (open being open source)
- kernel version 5.14 is used in openSUSE Leap 15.4
- uses zypper, the RPM-based package manager to install, update, and remove packages in the system
- includes the YaST (Yet another Setup Tool) application for system administration purposes
- SLES is widely used in retail and many other sectors
# Debian Family
- Debian
	- ==upstream for several distros==
	- pure open source community project (not owned by any corp) and has a strong focus on stability
	- largest and most complete software repo
- Ubuntu
	- upstream of Linux Mint
	- aims at providing a good compromise between long term stability and ease of use
- kernel version 5.19 is used in Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Long Term Support)
- uses APT, the DPKG-based package manager (using apt, apt-get, apt-cache, etc) to install, update, and remove packages in the system
- ubuntu has been widely used for cloud deployments
