## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be familiar with:
- How to create and edit files using the available Linux text editors.
- nano, a simple text-based editor.
- gedit, a simple graphical editor.
- vi and emacs, two advanced editors with both text-based and graphical interfaces.

## Overview of Text Editors in Linux
- at some point, you will to manually edit text files
	- you might be composing an email offline
	- writing a script to be used for bash or other command interpreters
	- altering a system or application configuration file
	- or developing source code for a programming language such as C, Python or Java
- Linux users and administrators may sidestep using a text editor, instead employing graphical utilities for creating and modifying system configuration files
	- however, this can be both more laborious than directly using a text editor and more limited in capability
	- in fact, word processing applications (including those that are part of common office application suites) are not really basic text editors
	- they add a lot of extra (usually invisible) formatting information that will probably render system administration configuration files unusable for their intended purposes
	- thus, knowing how to confidently use one or more text editors is really an essential skill to have for Linux
- by now, you have certainly realized Linux is packed with choices; when it comes to text editors, there are many choices, ranging from quite simple to very complex, including:
	- nano
	- gedit
	- vi
	- emacs
- in this section, we learn first about nano and gedit editors, which are relatively simple and easy to learn, and then later the more complicated choices, vi and emacs
- another product that has gained in usage and popularity is Microsoft's Visual Studio Code, usually abbreviated as code when used in Linux
	- this is actually a fully featured integrated development environment and far from lightweight, but many new Linux users are already used to it from working in other OSs
	- installation details vary from one distribution to another and usually involve incorporating additional package repositories
## Creating Files without using an Editor
- sometimes, you may want to create a short file and not want to bother invoking a full text editor
	- furthermore, doing so can be quite useful when used from within scripts, even when creating longer files
		- you will no doubt find yourself using this method when you start on the later chapters that cover shell scripting
- if you want to create a file without using an editor, there are two standard ways to create one from the command line and fill it with content
- the first is to use "echo" repeatedly:
	- $ echo line one > myfile
	- $ echo line two >> myfile
	- $ echo line three >> myfile
	- note that while a single greater-than sign (>) will send the output of a command to a file (and obliterate any already existing version of that file!), two of them (>>) will append the new output to an existing file
- the second way is to use "cat" combined with redirection:
	- $ cat << EOF > myfile
	- > line one
	- > line two
	- > line three
	- > EOF
	- $
	- in this example, the string used to show the beginning and end of the process need not be EOF; it could be STOP or any other string not used in the content itself.
- both techniques produce a file with the ff. lines in it:
	- line one
	- line two
	- line three
- and are extremely useful when employed by scripts
## nano and gedit
- there are some text editors that are pretty obvious
	- they require no particular experience to learn and are actually quite capable, even robust
- a particularly easy-to-use one is the text terminal-based editor "nano"
	- just invoke "nano" by giving a file name as an argument
	- all you help you need is displayed at the bottom of the screen, and you should be able to proceed without any problem
- as a graphical editor, gedit is part of the GNOME desktop system (kwrite is associated with KDE)
	- the gedit and kwrite editors are very easy to use and are extremely capable
	- they are also very configurable
	- they look a lot like Notepad in Windows
	- other variants, such as kate, are also supported by KDE
### nano
- nano is easy to use, and requires very little effort to learn
- to open a file:
	- type "nano \<filename\>" and press Enter
	- if the file does not exist, it will be created
- nano provides a two line shortcut bar at the bottom of the screen that lists the available commands
- some of these commands are:
	- CTRL-G: Display the help screen
	- CTRL-O: Write to a file
	- CTRL-X: Exit a file
	- CTRL-R: Insert contents from another file to the current buffer
	- CTRL-C: Show cursor position
### gedit
- gedit (pronounced "g-edit") is a simple-to-use graphical editor that can only be run within a Graphical Desktop Environment
- it is visually quite similar to the Notepad text editor in Windows, but is actually far more capable and very configurable and has a wealth of plugins available to extend its capabilities further
- to open a new file, find the program in your desktop's menu system, or from the command line type "gedit \<filename\>"
	- if the file does not exist, it will be created
- using gedit is pretty straightforward and does not require much training and its interface is composed of quite familiar elements
## Visual Studio Code
- Visual Studio Code (code) is another simple-to-use graphical editor
- it has a lot of functionality besides being used as a text editor
## vi and emacs
- developers and administrators experienced in working on UNIX-like systems almost always use one of the two venerable editing options: "vi" and "emacs"
- both are present or easily available on all distributions and are completely compatible with the versions available on other OSs
- both vi and emacs have a basic, purely text-based form that can run in a non-graphical environment
- they also have one or more graphical interface forms with extended capabilities
	- these may be friendlier for a less experienced user
- while vi and emacs can have significantly steep learning curves for new users, they are extremely efficient when one has learned how to use them
- you need to be aware that fights among seasoned users over which editor is better can be quite intense and are often described as a holy war
	- it is clear, however, that there are many more users of vi than there are of emacs
- both editing programs are here to stay no matter what
### vi
- usually, the actual program installed on your system is vim, which stands for "Vi IMproved" and is aliased to the name vi
	- the name is pronounced as "vee-eye"
- even if you do not want to use "vi", it is good to gain some familiarity with it
	- it is a standard tool installed on virtually all Linux distributions
	- indeed, there may be times when there is no other editor available on the system 
- GNOME extends vi with a very graphical interface known as "gvim" and KDE offers "kvim"
	- either of these may be easier to use at first
- when using vi, all commands are entered through the keyboard
	- you do not need to keep moving your hands to use a pointer device such as a mouse or touchpad, unless you want to do so when using one of the graphical versions of the editor
- ==Modes in vi:==
	- Command:
		- by default, vi starts in Command mode
		- each key is an editor command
		- keyboard strokes are interpreted as commands that can modify file contents
	- Insert:
		- type "i" (or a, A, any number of commands that enable Insert mode) to switch to Insert mode from Command mode
		- Insert mode is used to enter (insert) text into a file
		- Insert mode is indicated by an "? INSERT ?" indicator at the bottom of the screen
		- press "ESC" to exit Insert mode and return to Command mode
	- Line:
		- type ":" to switch to the Line mode from Command mode
		- each key is an external command, including operations such as writing the file contents to disk or exiting
		- uses line editing commands inherited from older line editors
			- most of these commands are actually no longer used
		- some line editing commands are very powerful
		- press "ESC" to exit Line mode and return to Command mode
- ==Working with Files in vi==:
	- check help pages in vim for list of commands
- ==Changing Cursor Positions in vi==:
	- check help pages in vim for list of commands
- ==Searching for Text in vi==:
	- check help pages in vim for list of commands
- ==Working with Text in vi==:
	- check help pages in vim for list of commands
### vimtutor
- typing "vimtutor" launches a short but very comprehensive tutorial for those who want to learn their first vi commands
- even though it provides only an introduction and just seven lessons, it has enough material to make you a very proficient vi user, because it covers a large number of commands
- after learning these basic ones, you can look up new tricks to incorporate into your list of vi commands because there are always more optimal ways to do things in vi with less typing
- ==PERSONAL NOTE==: Was interesting to go through all 7 lessons, you can quickly get a grasp of the controls since a lot of them have common themes like the "motions"
### emacs
- ==PERSONAL NOTE==: I skipped the emacs section because I want to improve on vim first before exploring emacs
