# Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
- Use different sources of documentation.
- Use the man pages.
- Access the GNU Info System.
- Use the **help** command and **--help** option.
- Use other documentation sources.
# Linux Documentation Sources
- =="man "pages (short for **man**ual)==
	- most often-used source of Linux documentation
	- provides in-depth documentation about many programs and utilities, as well as other topics, including configuration files and programming APIs for system calls, library routines, and the kernel
	- present on all Linux distros
	- typing man with a topic name as an argument retrieves the information stored in the topic's man pages 
	- the man pages are divided into nine (9) chapters 1 through 9. 
	- Sometimes, a letter is appended to the chapter number to identify a specific topic. 
		- eg: X Window API is chapter 3X
	- =="-a" option: displays all pages on the topic==, one after the other
	- =="-f" option: lists all pages on the topic==, displays the manual page descriptions of any name matched.
		- generates the same result as typing ==whatis==
	- =="-k" option: lists pages that discuss the topic==, even if the subject is not present in the name
		- generates the same result as typing ==apropos==
	- the default order (and other defaults) is specified in ==/etc/man_db.conf==
- ==GNU Info System==
	- GNU project's standard documentation format, which it prefers as an alternative to man
	- is freeform and supports linked subsections
	- functionally, resembles man in many ways. 
	- however, topics are connected using links, and information can be viewed through either a CLI, a graphical help utility, printed or viewed online
	- sometimes provides more complete (detailed) information on the topic 
	- =="info" \<topic\>==:
		- the topic which you view in an info page is a called a ==node==
		- nodes are essentially sections and subsections in the documentation
		- you can move between nodes or view each node sequentially
		- each node may contain menus and linked subtopics, or items
			- items function like browser links and are identified by an asterisk (\*) at the beginning of the item name
			- named items are identified with double-colons (::) at the end of the item name
			- items can refer to other nodes within the file or to other files
- =="--help" option==
	- most commands have an available short description which can be viewed using the --help or the -h option along with the command or application
	- eg: man --help
	- the --help option is useful as a quick reference and it displays information faster than the man or info pages
- =="help" command==
	- displays a synopsis of built-in commands
	- when used with another command, acts the same as the --help option
- other documentation sources
	- ==Gentoo Handbook==
	- ==Ubuntu docs==
	- ==Fedora docs==
