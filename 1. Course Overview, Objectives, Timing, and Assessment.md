You should expect to spend approximately 50-60 hours to complete this course. You have access to this course for 12 months from the date you registered, or until your subscription expires (whichever happens first).

The chapters in the course have been designed to build on one another. It is probably best to work through them in sequence; if you skip or only skim some chapters quickly, you may find there are topics being discussed you have not been exposed to yet. But this is all self-paced, you can always go back, thread your own path through the material, and return to exactly where you left off when you come back to start a new session. However, we still suggest you avoid long breaks in between periods of work, as learning will be faster and content retention improved.

At the end of each chapter, you will find a series of knowledge check questions. These questions were designed with one main goal in mind: to help you better comprehend the course content and reinforce what you have learned. The end-of-chapter knowledge check questions are not graded. However, at the end of the course, you will need to complete a final exam and achieve a score of 70% or higher to successfully complete the course.
