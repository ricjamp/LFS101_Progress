# Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
- Manipulate strings to perform actions such as comparison and sorting.
- Use Boolean expressions when working with multiple data types, including strings or numbers, as well as files.
- Use **case** statements to handle command line options.
- Use looping constructs to execute one or more lines of code repetitively.
- Debug scripts using set **-x** and set **+x**.
- Create temporary files and directories.
- Create and use random numbers.
# String Manipulation
- a string variable contains a sequence of text characters
	- it can include letters, numbers, symbols and punctuation marks
		- eg. "abcde", "123", "abcde 123", "abcde-123"
	- string operators include those that do comparison, sorting, and finding the length
- basic string operators:
	- \[\[ string1 > string2 \]\]
		- compares the sorting order of string1 and string2
	- \[\[ string1 \=\= string 2 \]\]
		- compares the characters in string1 with the characters in string2
	- myLen1=$(#string1)
		- saves the length of string1 in the variable myLen1
	- ==NOTE==: in most cases, we can use single square brackets ( \[ \] ) instead of double ( \[\[ \]\] ) in comparisons and logical tests, but the more modern doubled form helps avoid some errors, such as those that can arise when doing a comparison with empty strings and environment variables
## Parts of a String
- at times, you may not need to compare or use an entire string
- to extract the first n characters of a string, we can specify: "$(string:0:n)"
	- here, 0 is the offset in the string (ie. which character to begin from) where the extraction needs to start, and n is the number of characters to be extracted
- to extract all characters in a string after a dot (.), use the ff. expression:
	- ${string#\*.}
