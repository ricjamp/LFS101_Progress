# Three Important Pieces of Context

1. Things change in Linux
	- linux is constantly evolving, there will be features that are not discussed
2. We gave repeated some things in the class material
	- important concepts are repeated by design to help with the learning process
3. We have tried to avoid "holy wars"
	- hilarious to me
## Best way to learn Linux is by DOING
